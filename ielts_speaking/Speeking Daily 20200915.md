### Examples

1. First-tier cities in China are pretty developed. They are literally concrete jungles; skyscrapers are everywhere and a child can easily get lost in them.
2. I have awful impression of this city because litters are all over the places and the walls if historical monuments are full of graffiti.
3. Many elderly people move from the cities to rural areas because they can't take the pollution anymore. They want to take a break and see more of the nature and spend time in green outdoor spaces.
4. Hongkong is a shopper's paradise not only because of the wide range of stores but also relatively cheaper prices of brand-name items.
5. I grew up and lived in a rundown town and all you can see are boarded up shops. It's not worth visiting, so I don't invite my friends to it.

When I was a senior school student, I consider accounting an engaging job, I always imagined myself sitting at an office desk doing paperwork. At that time, I was so excited to go to college because an fascinating part of my life would start and I could finally chase my dream; however, a heartbreaking news shattered it--the result of my college entrance exam came and I got a low mark. As a result, I studied another subject which was tedious, so every minute of my college life was awful. What added to my misery was the uninteresting teachers who loved to talk to their students before class. Luckily, I has absorbing classmates who could still make me laugh with their tedious jokes.
